                <p>
                    Living and studying in Brisbane, Australia, Darren graduated with a tertiary degree in graphic
                    design in 2007. He has subsequently made a living working on a broad range of design projects across
                    commercial, government and not-for-profit sectors, with a particular interest in conceptual design,
                    editorial, and brand identity for small to medium business.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2016, Darren was inspired to pursue his aptitude and passion for fine art.
                </p>
                
                <p>

                    “For as long as I can remember, I have loved to draw. It’s always been very instinctual, and a form
                    of meditation in a way, even from a very young age. I have never had art lessons or drawing
                    instruction. Some may say it’s a natural ability, but it is really years of experimentation,
                    practice and patience.”
                </p>

                ​
                <p>

                    A long-held fascination with the natural world, and the relationships between that which make it
                    their home, inspires much of Darren’s work. Every composition is exquisitely hand-drawn, capturing
                    the finest details in a contemporary aesthetic that celebrates the chosen subject. His work relates
                    both a keen observation of reality with an infusion of whimsey, and visual conversation between
                    subjects and their environments. No grid reference techniques are used, meaning every piece is drawn
                    purely “by eye” and come to life over hours, weeks, sometimes months of work.
                </p>

                ​
                <p>

                    “I’ve always been taken by works of realism and motivated by the challenge highly detailed subjects
                    present. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I am drawn to wildlife as a subject, with such an
                    incredible gamut of furs, plumage and musculature. It can be painstaking at times, but the result is
                    satisfying.”
                </p>
                
                <p>

                    Darren works exclusively with the highest quality, artist-grade soft pastels and pastel pencils with
                    rich, finely ground pigments and light resistance confirmed by the most rigorous international
                    testing.
                </p>

                
                <p>

                    “Pencils remain my favourite tool because of the control, precision and line quality they allow,
                    plus they’re (mostly) clean to work with. The technology and craftsmanship behind today’s
                    professional-grade pencil is a massive departure from the humble colour pencil that typically comes
                    to mind. You can achieve fantastic detail, depth and luminosity in your work, plus they are fully
                    archival to museum standard.”
                </p>

                
                <p>

                    Darren’s work has been selected for various local and national exhibitions. He has been a finalist
                    in the Brisbane Rotary Art Spectacular and a four-time finalist and two-time category winner in the
                    Lethbridge 20000 Small Scale Art Award in Australia. Two of Darren’s pieces were selected for
                    publication in the tenth edition of Strokes of Genius: The Best of Drawing published by Northlight
                    Books, and his work has appeared in art magazines internationally.

                    A portion of all sales from Darren's art supports conservation and animal welfare projects
                    throughout the world
