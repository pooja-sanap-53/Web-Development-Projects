                Further many couples even return children they have adapted back to agencies. These children are

        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 40px;">What Is The Best Way To Help?</h1>
        <p class="help"><br>
            Every person ever conceived, was born with specific needs. Those needs include, critical needs such as food and shelter, security, the knowledge or belief that one is of value to themselves and others. Children will first seek their critical needs...and the supply of those critical needs will instill a learned behavior. And then they will seek the other needs as well, and the source of those needs will again become a learned behavior. For example, if a starving child learns that the surest way to not be hungry is to steal...they will learn that behavior as a means of survival. If being for example, a child soldier, or a terrorist means that they are fed, clothed and receive attention and praise from an adult figure, again they will learn that these types of behavior bring them rewards...supplying them with their needs. In a sense they will become what they have learned in their struggle to survive and belong. In essence, every orphan child will either perish or receive his or her basic human needs from some source...good or bad. It is up to those who have the means and the opportunity, to be sure that the source of their care is a source with good intentions. If we don't, it will be the pimps, slave traders, ill-willed relative, thieves, gangsters, warlords and terrorists that do.
